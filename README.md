# N-Queens
N-Queens solver and visualization of permutation process to find solutions. This code uses 8 x 8 Board, but can be used with any number from 2 to 8 or more. Be careful of Time Complexity for n > 8.

```js
// n is hard coded as 8
const board = new Board(8);
board.start();
```

The code uses Pseudoclassical pattern, and the algorithm uses Recusrsion, Permutation and Backtracking to speed up the process.
